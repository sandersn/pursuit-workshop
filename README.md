# Pursuit Typescript Open Source Workshop

## Overview Notes

1. Small -- probably 4 participants per TS team member. Maybe 5?
2. Choose issues ahead of time, ask others to stay away from them, pre-solve them.
3. TSJS-lib-generator was a good option (with the above caveats). Typescript website too.
4. Target audience is alumni, who have finished the course.
5. Maybe 3-4 hours long, 3/4 hour presentation + 3 hours of hands-on.

## Prerequisites

1. Javascript (and/or Typescript)
2. git (github helps, but we'll cover it)
