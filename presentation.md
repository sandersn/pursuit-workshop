## Why Open Source

### What You Get From Contributing to Open Source

You get experience with basic software engineering skills that are hard to teach in the classroom.

- Working with people to find the right fix to a bug
- Jumping into new code that you don't know.
- Asking people for help when you need it.
- Learning how projects are run, technically AND socially.

Open source is a great way to round out an education, and companies know this.
Downside is that it's basically "spec work" -- if you're in it to get experience, you can do a lot of work for free that ends up unused.

### What Corporations Get From Open Source

- Source code is often less valuable than the product's brand and its ecosystem.
- Packages your program use are more reliable when they're open source -- you can submit your own fixes.
- Pretty good for infrastructure, which
- It's easier to build up fans for a software product.

### What I Get From Open Source

As a full-time software engineer, the things I get from open source are a mix of the previous two.

- Co-operation is important, even between companies.
- Attribution is important: authors have a chance to benefit from their work even if a corporation owns it.
- Encourages industry-wide personal connections.
- I get a chance to fix bugs I care about.
- I get a chance to work on things I care about.
- It's easier to learn by copying.

The flip side: "Building your personal brand" is 21st-century-dystopian in which GoFundMe has replaced insurance. There's a chance it might turn into something non-horrible in the next few generations, but it's more likely in Europe or a reformed China than the in the United States.

## How to choose a project

- Choose something you use, in the language and ecosystem you know best
- Think of a bug or missing feature, or check for "help wanted" bugs
- Small and new is better because the code will be simpler, the bugs will be easier, and the contributions will be more noticeable.

Now let's look at Typescript, an 8-year-old compiler with one file that's 35,000 lines long!

## How to get started

- Find the README and CONTRIBUTING files
- Install all the prerequisites.
- Build and run all the tests. Make sure everything works.
   If it doesn't, start asking for help, more on that in a minute.
- Find tests and deface one. Rebuild and test; make sure it fails.
- Find the source and search for words that sound like your desired feature.
  This sounds stupid but it's how it works.
  Well, start with README and CONTRIBUTING since they'll help direct your search.
- Look through the list of likely places and choose the most likely.
- Deface the source and make sure tests fail.
  There might not be enough test coverage, in which case: boo.
- Now go back to the test and modify it to test your case.
- Go back to the source and try to make your change.
- Repeat testing and changing code until the test passes.
- Copy your test to a new test, revert the changes to the old test and rerun all the tests.

## How to ask for help

- First, look for a place to get help.
  - Comment on the Github issue.
  - Look for a discord.
  - Look for a twitter handle of a maintainer
    (This is better for small projects.)
- State what you're trying to do
- Copy links to what you read for help (this means you'll have to keep the tabs open)
- Copy commands that you ran or code you wrote
- Show the bad output, along with what you expected to see

# Hands-on

- Split into groups (maybe sign up beforehand)
- Walk through set up for the repo
- Choose an example bug? Or maybe each choose a bug.
- Consider working in groups
- Ask for help in common chat
